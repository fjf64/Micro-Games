# Micro-Games
All of my experiments on one repository
This is my collection, in the case my files are wiped and contain many projects. some however, are unfinished or unrefined, and will probably not be finished.
All current files are possible to run in python without packages, meaning it is possible to run on websites. 
Not all of these are games, some are just tests. 
Feel free to post issues or pull requests if needed. 
My personal favorite online site to run and make these are https://www.online-python.com/
